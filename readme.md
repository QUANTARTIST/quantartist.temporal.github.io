This visualization was completed for MICA’s Contexts of Information Visualization course, assignment 4. Students were asked to visualize a temporal data set relating to human life.
The framework for this visualization has been adapted from Nic Girault's circosJS library which can be found here: <br><br>https://github.com/nicgirault/circosJS<br><br>
This visualization is a circular heatmap reflecting hours of exercize for every day of the year in 2016. Those days which incurred more exercise appear as darker shades of red.
